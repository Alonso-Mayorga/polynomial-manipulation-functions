# Polynomial Manipulation Functions

This repository contains Python functions for polynomial manipulation:

## 'monic_factors' 

Computes monic irreducible factors of a polynomial.

```python
from polynomial_functions import monic_factors
factors, remaining = monic_factors([1, -3, 2, 0, -4])
```

## 'polynomial_product'

Calculates the product of two polynomials

```python
from polynomial_functions import polynomial_product
product = polynomial_product([1, 2, 3], [2, -1])
```

## 'polynomial_sum'

Calculates the sum of two polynomials

```python
from polynomial_functions import polynomial_sum
sum_result = polynomial_sum([1, 2, 3], [2, -1, 0, 1])
```

## Usage

To use these functions, include them in your MATLAB environment and follow the examples provided in the code comments or in the README of the repository.
